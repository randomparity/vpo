**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-23
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs

- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria

## Notes

- All items passed validation
- Spec is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- The spec leverages reasonable defaults based on:
  - Existing Jobs dashboard patterns (pagination page size of 50, table styling)
  - Standard resolution naming conventions (1080p, 4K, etc.)
  - ISO 639-2 language codes already stored in the database
  - REST API patterns consistent with existing codebase
