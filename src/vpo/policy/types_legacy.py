"""Policy engine data models (legacy module).

This module is DEPRECATED. New code should import from vpo.policy.types instead.

All types have been extracted to the types/ package:
- types/enums.py: Core enums and constants
- types/transcode.py: Transcode configuration types
- types/filters.py: Track filter types
- types/conditions.py: Condition types
- types/actions.py: Action types
- types/plan.py: Plan and execution types
- types/schema.py: Policy schema types

This module re-exports all types for backward compatibility.
